Social media platform are interactive computer-mediated technologies that facilitate
the creation or sharing of information, ideas, career interests and other forms of expression
via virtual communities and networks. The variety of stand-alone and built-in social media
services currently available introduces challenges of definition; however, there are some
common features:
  * Social media are interactive Web 2.0 Internet-based applications.
  * User-generated content such as text posts or comments, digital photos or videos,
  and data generated through all online interactions, is the lifeblood of social media.
  * Users create service-specific profiles and identities for the website or app that are
    designed and maintained by the social media organization.
  * Social media facilitate the development of online social networks by connecting a
    user's profile with those of other individuals or groups.
    
Users usually access social media services via web-based apps on desktops and laptops,
or download services that offer social media functionality to their mobile devices
(e.g., smartphones and tablets). As users engage with these electronic services, they create
highly interactive platforms through which individuals, communities, and organizations
can share, co-create, discuss, participate and modify user-generated content or self-curated
content posted online.
